                                Choosing the safest and most efficient roads or bike paths is paramount. Utilize mapping apps like Google Maps (with cycling layer), Strava, or Komoot that highlight dedicated bike lanes, shared-use paths, quiet residential streets, and safe crossings. A well-planned route can drastically reduce stress, avoid high-traffic areas, and increase your overall safety in urban environments. Consider factors like time of day, road surface, elevation changes, and the presence of bike racks at your destination when planning. Always have a backup route in mind.

                                <strong>Tips for Route Planning:</strong>
                                <ul class="text-start">
                                    <li><strong>Bike Lanes:</strong> Prioritize routes with dedicated or protected bike lanes where available.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Low-Traffic Streets:</strong> Even if slightly longer, quieter streets can be safer and more enjoyable.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Avoid "Door Zones":</strong> If riding next to parked cars, leave enough space (at least 1 meter) to avoid suddenly opening doors.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Pre-Ride Scouting:</strong> For new routes, consider a preliminary ride during off-peak hours to familiarize yourself.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Weather Considerations:</strong> Plan routes that offer shelter or are less prone to flooding during heavy rains.</li>
                                </ul>

                            <p class="card-text text-start" style="color: var(--text-dark);">
                                Learn how to position yourself confidently and interact predictably with cars, buses, and pedestrians. Often, "taking the lane" (riding in the center of the lane, or far enough left to avoid the "door zone" of parked cars) is the safest position to be visible and avoid unexpected hazards. Be assertive but polite, maintaining eye contact with drivers, and always assuming you are not seen until you have confirmed it. Be aware of blind spots for larger vehicles, especially trucks and buses. Never ride directly alongside large vehicles or in their blind spots.
                                <br><br>
                                <strong>Key Traffic Interactions:</strong>
                                <ul class="text-start">
                                    <li><strong>Eye Contact:</strong> Make eye contact with drivers, especially at intersections or when they are turning.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Predictability:</strong> Ride in a straight line, use clear hand signals, and avoid sudden swerving.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Passing Parked Cars:</strong> Leave at least a car door's width of space to avoid "dooring."</li>
                                    <li><strong>Left Turns:</strong> If no bike box or dedicated lane, you might need to "take the lane" well in advance, signal, and act like a car.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Right Turns:</strong> Be wary of "right hook" collisions where a vehicle turns right across your path. Scan for turning vehicles and proceed with caution.</li>
                                </ul>

                                Navigating complex urban areas like multi-lane intersections, roundabouts, and bike boxes requires confidence and clear communication. Understand the specific rules for cyclists in these areas, which can vary by locality. Use clear and early hand signals, establish eye contact, and position yourself assertively. In roundabouts, act like a car, taking the lane to prevent vehicles from cutting you off. Be aware of "right hook" and "left cross" collision types, which are common at intersections. If you feel unsafe taking the lane, consider dismounting and walking your bike across crosswalks, but always prioritize safety.

                                    <li><strong>Traffic Lights:</strong> Obey them like a car. If the light doesn't trip for your bike, refer to local laws on how to proceed safely.</li>
                                    <li><strong>"Idaho Stop" or "Delaware Stop" (Check local laws):</strong> Some places allow cyclists to treat stop signs as yields or red lights as stop signs after a complete stop if clear. *Always verify this is legal in your specific location before doing so.* In the Philippines, standard traffic laws apply unless specific LGU ordinances state otherwise.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Backpacks:</strong> Good for lighter loads and short commutes. Look for cycling-specific backpacks with good ventilation.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Panniers:</strong> Bags that attach to front or rear racks, keeping weight off your back and lowering the center of gravity. Excellent for heavier loads or longer commutes.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Baskets:</strong> Front or rear mounted for quick access and larger, irregularly shaped items. Can be quick-release for easy removal.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Frame Bags:</strong> Fit within the bike's main triangle, good for tools, snacks, or smaller items, offering better weight distribution.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Seatpost Bags (Saddle Bags):</strong> Small bags under the saddle for essentials like tools and spare tubes. Larger ones can carry clothes for longer rides.</li>
                                </ul>
                                Always distribute weight evenly to maintain bike balance and control. Test your bike's handling with a full load before a critical ride.

                                Secure your bike with a high-quality lock (or two!). A U-lock and a chain lock used together offer excellent deterrence. Learn proper locking techniques: always lock your frame to an immovable object (bike rack, sturdy signpost, etc.) and if possible, secure at least one wheel with the same lock or a second one. Avoid leaving your bike in isolated, dark, or high-theft areas for extended periods. Consider bike registration programs (if available from local LGU or cycling groups) to aid recovery if stolen.

                                    <li><strong>Secure to Immovable Objects:</strong> Always lock to a fixed, sturdy object that cannot be easily cut or removed.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Fill the Lock:</strong> Fill as much of the U-lock shackle as possible with your bike and the immovable object, leaving less room for leverage tools.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Remove Valuables:</strong> Take off lights, quick-release accessories, and any bags.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Consider Bike Storage:</strong> In offices or homes, secure your bike indoors whenever possible.</li>

                                In urban settings, visibility is your best defense. Use bright lights (white front, red rear) even during the day, as daytime running lights significantly increase your presence. Wear reflective gear and bright, contrasting clothing. Make eye contact with drivers, pedestrians, and other cyclists to ensure you are seen and acknowledged. Consider reflective tape on your bike frame, helmet, and even your shoes. The more angles you can be seen from, the safer you'll be.

                                <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Research Thoroughly:</strong> Check online cycling groups, forums, or apps (Strava, Komoot, RideWithGPS) for route reviews, recent conditions, and local insights. Look for user-generated maps.</li>
                                <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Go with a Group:</strong> Especially when exploring new or less familiar areas. Group rides provide safety in numbers and shared knowledge.</li>
                                <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Tell Someone Your Plan:</strong> Inform a friend or family member of your planned route, estimated duration, and expected return time. Share your live location if possible.</li>
                                <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Be Prepared for Anything:</strong> Always carry a basic repair kit, sufficient water (more than you think you need in the Philippine heat!), snacks, and emergency contact information. A small first-aid kit is also advisable.</li>
                                <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Stay Hydrated & Fueled:</strong> Especially in the tropical Philippine climate, dehydration can set in quickly. Drink regularly and carry energy-dense snacks for longer rides.</li>
                                <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Check Weather:</strong> Before heading out, check the weather forecast. Heavy rain can make roads slippery and reduce visibility. Thunderstorms can be dangerous.</li>
                                <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Consider E-Bikes:</strong> For longer commutes or hilly recreational routes, e-bikes can make cycling more accessible and enjoyable.</li>
                                <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Join Local Cycling Clubs:</strong> This is an excellent way to discover new routes and learn from experienced local riders. They often organize regular rides.</li>
